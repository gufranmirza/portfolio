The idea behind building Publisher Protocol is building a fully decentralized Protocol for building Blogging Platform on Polkaldot and IPFS.

A custom made Blockchain where interactions and metadata about Blogs & People is stored on chain by storing the hash of the content. A community
DAO and Treasury is set with the platform to further development of the platform.

This blockchain is supposed to be run as a side chain on the Polkadot blockchain. Building it whenever i have some spare time, it is still a POC.
